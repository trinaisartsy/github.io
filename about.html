<div><h1> Who is Trina? </h1><br>
I sometimes like to call myself the Macgyver of Art because I can't really pin point my favorite medium to work with. The truth is, I actually just gravitate towards experimenting with a wide variety of techniques. I don't like to pigeon hold myself into a certain style. Variety is important - variety is what breaks up monotony. Viewers should expect the unexpected when it comes to my approach to a project.</div>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />
But like the saying goes, "There is method to the madness" and I have found a few things to be consistently true about my art:<br />
  <br /><ul><br />
<li>&nbsp;I am always trying to add a twist or asking myself how I can push a work over the edge. As an artist, the idea of creating something completely unique and never seen before intrigues me.</li>
</ul><br />
<ul>
<li>I try to have a lack of inhibition towards the rules of traditional art. Nothing is quite exact, everything is organic, approximate. I don't bother myself with the pursuit of perfection, instead I like to let my work grow naturally from it's seed idea, to develop on its own as a surprise.<br /></li>
<br />
<li>There is a heavy use of color. Like, lots and lots of colors. Almost too much color. If you're overwhelmed by the colors then it feels like I've done my job.</li>
</ul>

If I have to recall the earliest influences in my style, growing up with Sam Rami classics like "Army of Darkness" and "Xena: The Warrior Princess" come to mind. Writer and illustrator Jhonen Vasquez was always a big inspiration with his intricate and funny drawings of monsters. Watching my dad copy Sonic the Hedgehog comic book covers taught me the value of patience and payoff. These are the things I think about when I consider where my artwork comes truly from. There is something childishly nostalgic about the act of creation, I think.<br />

I've also always had a strong urge to share that process with other people. Ever since I can remember, there has been an immense pride attached to being able to share my gift with others. I like getting reactions from people with my work- imploring interest, shock, joy or sadness. Another motivation is genuinely enjoying creating art in the presence of other people and being able to share my knowledge in a meaningful way that inspires imagination in others. Through inspired workshops and online tutorials I continue to work on spreading the joy of making art to those who are willing to learn.</div>
