Want to learn how to be an artist? Your sketchbook is the best place to begin. We will get started personalizing and adding inspiration to your book, incorporating drawing prompts and exercises to get your creative juices flowing. You will provide your own sketchbook. Some essential art supplies will be provided, but it's encouraged to bring your favorite supplies as well.
