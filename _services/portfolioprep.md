Students will bring their current portfolio for review. We will analyze the requirements for the AP Art portfolio together and begin organizing plans for artwork that will apply to those requirements. We will discuss the elements of design, how to correctly photograph artworks for digital display and how to properly prepare a portfolio for submission to the College Board.
