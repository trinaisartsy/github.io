Why Pick Trina as Your Artist?
------------------------------

I am a learner at heart, and I enjoy sharing my discoveries and knowledge with the world. I have studied under local working artists including [Phillip Hyman](https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/prolific-artist-phillip-hyman-spreads-the-love-underground/Content?oid=2410259), [Tate Nation](https://www.tatenation.com/) and [Peggie Hartwell](http://www.peggiehartwell.com/). In school, I participated in every extracurricular art class available to me and made strong marks on my 2010 Advance Placement Art Portfolio (3*). I've taught art in a variety of settings including summer camps, drink and paint studios, and one on one tutoring. For more information on my experience, visit my Linkedin.  
  
 I am available for one on one instruction or small classes in a variety of artistic principals and I have flexible hours to fit your busy schedule. Available on weekends or after school. Contact me to discuss specifics such as class location and booking times.  
  
Skype Session Available - Too far away to make it to class? Book a class via Skype. Contact me for more details.  
  
\* I could've done better on my AP art score, but I missed a lot of important things about the portfolio that in hindsight I would've fixed. If only I had someone to give me that advice!  I wrote about the experience on my blog - I highly recommend the read to any stressed out teen who is struggling with their portfolio.
