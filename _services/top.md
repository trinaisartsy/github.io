I provide a number of creative services and I would be more than happy to take on your next big
idea. I'm very familiar with the foundation of art and design and have a background in teaching art classes to kids and adults- the perfect tutor for a kiddo preparing to apply to a visual arts magnet school or a budding artist trying to bulk up their portfolio.

Trina will provide the canvas, materials and everything you need to paint something wonderful. You bring your friends and a little something to get the creative juices flowing! Trina will meet you at your home or office, or she can arrange for a beutiful venue right off of I26. [Book now via Hubspot](https://meetings.hubspot.com/trinaisartsy) by choosing your preferred time and Trina will reach out to talk details and to finalize the booking.
