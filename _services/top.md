Need an artist who will take pride in their work, follow through with projects and finish things in a timely manner? Look no further, I'm here to help.

I provide a number of creative services and I would be more than happy to take on your next big idea. I'm very familiar with the foundation of art and design and have a background in teaching art classes to kids and adults- the perfect tutor for a kiddo preparing to apply to a visual arts magnet school or a budding artist trying to bulk up their portfolio.

I can arrange meetings and classes at a beautiful venue right off of Charleston I26 or we can meet via Skype chat. [Book now via Hubspot](https://meetings.hubspot.com/trinaisartsy) by choosing your preferred time and date. I will reach out to talk details and to finalize the booking and send your invoice (cash.me or paypal payments available) I look forward to hearing from you soon!
