* "I had seen some of Trina's artwork, so one day I asked her to paint me a lion because I have never been able to find one I liked enough to buy...I explained to her what I wanted, and when I saw the finished product, I couldn’t have been happier. He’s perfect. He’s beautiful. I told Trina how grateful I was and how he was exactly what I wanted. It’s one of those situations where it turned out better than I could have ever imagined. She told me she painted it with love and I believe her. I know she did. I can tell she did. That’s just the type of person she is. She puts her heart, and more importantly her soul, into everything she does."

* "Trina helped guide me when I first started working at Wine and Design and I was impressed with her teaching and customer service skills. She is very creative and a gifted artist. I was also very impressed with my experience in working with Trina on a Fundraiser for The Flowertown Players Theater. Trina curated a pop up art show beautifully and completed set up, exhibition and take down in under 12 hours!"
