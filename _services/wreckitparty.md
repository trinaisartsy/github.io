Relieve stress and jump start your creativity simultaneously with this exciting artistic experience! You and your party will be provided with your very own brand new copies of Keri Smith's book "Wreck This Journal." Each page has a set of directions to follow that will subsequently "wreck" the book - creating unique pieces of art in the process. We will go through the best pages in the book and have fun being creative in our interpretations of the directions. Get ready to scribble wildly, create your own ink blots, dance on the pages and much more shenanigans in this guided class. Essential art supplies will be provided, but it's encouraged to bring your favorite supplies as well.
