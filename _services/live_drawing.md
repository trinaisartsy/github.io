 Want a fun artsy twist of a party favor for your next event? Have Trina attend and sketch up a storm! Trina will set up a booth with her easel and supplies, where patrons can sit comfortably and have their portraits drawn. Portraits take about 5-10 minutes to complete, depending on the style and if there is color. Your guests will be able to take home their original artwork free of charge - just pay booking fees! 
 
You can even choose between realistic portraits or caricature style portraits, and between color or black and white portraits.  

Available within a 30 mile radius of Charleston, SC. 

Prices start at $75 per hour.
