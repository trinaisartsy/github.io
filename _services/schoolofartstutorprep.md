Students will bring their current portfolio (if available) for review. We will analyze the application requirements for the student's audition and begin organizing plans for artwork that will apply to those requirements. We'll prepare for the interview / exam by going over what will be expected of the student, including questions they may be asked and by being familiarized with still life drawings, gestural drawings, sketching, ect.
