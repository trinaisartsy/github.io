# Owner/author information

  info: I'm a visual artist, writer, teacher, and so much more.

I've always had a strong urge to learn as much about my craft as I could. I love trying new techniques and adding unique "twists" to my work. Another motivation is genuinely enjoying creating art in the presence of other people and being able to share my knowledge in a meaningful way that sparks the imagination in others. Through inspired workshops and online tutorials I continue to work on spreading the joy of making art to those who are willing to learn
