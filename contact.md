## The Basics:
My name is Trina Lyn and I'm a coffee-fueled visual artist based out of Charleston, SC. I'm spunky, weird and colorful- qualities that often shine through in my artwork. I like to take pride in my undertakings and never go into a project half-hearted. I'm always looking for ways to bring new twists or fun concepts to the table while trying to learn a little bit about myself in the process.



## My Passion:
I like to share my gift with others through teaching and mentorship. Any day I can inspire another soul to create art is a good day for me. My favorite thing about sharing art with others is helping someone get past the initial anxiety of starting to learn a new craft. With contagious enthusiasm and a genuine love for everything creative, I like to think I have a knack for making others feel at home with the creative arts.





## Right Now:
My latest works reflect a paradigm shift for me - towards a more honest, introspective and maybe even care-free approach to my art. Never have I felt freer to "tell the truth" through my artwork, so to speak. I'm growing up and my work is maturing along with me. It has been a renaissance for me in many ways, so I'm excited to see where it all leads.
