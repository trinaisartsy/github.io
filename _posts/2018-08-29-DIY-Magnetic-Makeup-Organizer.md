# Possibly the BEST Make up Organization Solution...
 
 Creative organization solutions are a fascination of mine. All over my house- a smattering of strange hangers, wall pockets, homemade bags and plastic dollar store bins. Honestly, it's pretty awesome. However, there's one thing I had yet to get quite right...
 
 I was in desperate need of a handy way to store my makeup. I had the classic "crammed makeup bag" syndrome. Technically, everything fit in my bag, but only if I perfectly stacked everything back in a specific order and orientation, Tetris style. Just not very convenient when I'm in a hurry to finish my look before a night out and I have a pile of products strewn about, expecting to be tediously placed back in my bag before I leave. 
 
 By a stroke of genius (or should I say  _by scroll of Pinterest_) I came across this clever solution and I knew it would be perfect to suit my needs. As a bonus, it's on the cheap. I made use of some items I already had around the house only spent $10 on the rest of my supplies.  Read on for how I made this cute magnetic makeup organizer and other stylish beauty storage solutions.

# Go Cheap or Go Home!

I'm all about being economical with my organizing solutions. One of my goals is always to spend as little as possible without sacrificing too much functionality. I am a _huge_ fan of the Dollar Tree and I check there often for clever odds and ends that they occasionally supply. It's no secret that they have great glassware, so I picked up this glass vase to keep my brushes in. In a divine moment of zen, I came across a jar with a lid that fit _perfectly_ on top of the vase, so I snagged that too. I had a few left over glass stones from a previous Dollar Store haul that I tossed in the vase as well, which styled things up and helped stabilize the brushes a little better.  <br>

### Some other various supplies you should get from the dollar store:

- **Decals and Stickers:** I found some adorable crystal themed wall decals that really helped bring my little organizing set altogether. A simple embellishment can really make a difference in the finished look of your design. 

- **Amazing Office Supplies:** The Dollar Tree has some great scrapbooking and office supplies. Mounting tape, velcro, command hooks, vinyl, all for a fraction of what you'd pay at another store for nearly identical products. The quality can be touch and go, but for an everyday craft, these are great options.  

- **You can even get your magnetic pan there**. That's right, to make your crafty magnetic organizer, the dollar store even has cooking pans. Take a look here first before shelling out $10+ on a brand new baking pan or a giant metal sheet from the craft store. Just make sure it's actually magnetic!

I also saved a few bucks by repurposing some glass candle jars to keep my miscellaneous products.

# Making the Magnetic Makeup Organizer

## Finding the perfect metal pan

With all that being said.. I have to confess, my perfect pan ended up costing $7 from another local discount store. I know I know, _go cheap or go home_, but sometimes it ends up being better to pay a little more to get a little more, so to speak. My perfect pan turned out to be white ceramic and looked so fancy on its own that it didn't really need any extra decorations to dress it up. 

Your experience may vary here - **have fun and experiment** with decorating your magnetic pan. The perfect supplies will be drawn to you and depend on your individual aesthetics and needs. Think about your favorite colors, patterns, and themes. Options for dressing up your metal pan includes adding vinyl, framing, fabric, or spray paint. Let your creative side run wild.

## How to Attach the Magnets to your products

**Hi, please put down the hot glue gun**. For Pete's sake, don't melt your makeup with glue the temperature of molten lava... can I suggest, instead, picking up some double stick mounting tape? As mentioned earlier, the Dollar Tree has good solutions for this, but it can be picked up at any craft store too and it's a much less drastic solution compared to attaching the magnets with hell's fury.

If you were wondering, I used a mix of flat magnetic sheets and round ceramic magnets (both from the craft store,) depending on the product I was trying to add to my board. The sticky rounds were from the dollar store of course, but if they end up not sticking long term I'll invest in some name brand mounting tape. 


## The Zen of Organized Makeup
 
Putting all those previously hard to get to products on this magnetic board was extremely satisfying. This idea appealed to me because I can just grab what I need without thinking about it, and all my favorite items are clearly displayed so I can remember to use them! I can't tell you how many times I forgot I had a certain shade of eyeshadow or omitting a crucial step from my routine because the product was buried under other random items. **Those days are GONE!!!!!** Okay, maybe I'm a little bit _too_ excited.
