 Creative organization solutions are a fascination of mine. All over my house- a smattering of strange hangers, wall pockets, home made bags and plastic dollar store bins. Honestly, it's pretty awesome. However, there's one thing I had yet to get quite right. I was in desperate need of a handy way to store my makeup. I had the classic "crammed makeup bag" syndrome. Technically, everything fit in my bag, but only if I perfectly stacked everything back in a specific order and orientation, Tetris style. Just not very convenient when I'm in a hurry to finish my look before a night out and I have a pile of products strewn about, expecting to be tediously placed back in my bag before I leave. By stroke of genius (or should I say  _by scroll of Pinterest_) I came across this clever solution and I knew it would be perfect to suit my needs.  Read on for how I made this cute organizing kit and tips on making your own.
