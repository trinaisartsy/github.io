Everyone knows crafting is better with a friend- and sometimes you just need a few extra hands!

My good friend Racheal had this crusty little ottoman with good bones, all it needed was a bit of love. She found it on curb alert - its leather exterior has worn and cracked, but on the bottom it still clearly has a $60 price tag from Ross. 

After a day's worth of work and fiddling around, trying different things until it was perfect, we came up with this beauty. Pretty dramatic difference if you ask me:

Neither of us really had experience reupholstering anything before, but I think the results still turned out pretty fantastic. Anyone can give a project like this a try though as long as you have the right tools for the job and a little bit of gumption! From one beginner to another, let me give you some tips to make your own reupholstery project a success.

## How two newbies totally made over this freakin' ottoman (and so can you!)  

# Gather the supplies

1. [An industrial stapler / staple gun](http://a.co/9hZ0Tho "An example of an industrial stapler sold on Amazon.") - A heavy duty stapler really makes this job easier. It's strong enough to puncture the wood unlike a regular stapler, and the only way you can remove the staples is with a pair of plyers. You might want to spring for an extra pack of staplers so you don't run out mid project!

2. A TON of Fabric - Well, I guess not a ton. Really just a yard or two. We used a bed sheet for the body of the ottoman and there was a bit left over. For reference, queen sized sheets are about 2 yards of fabric. 

3. Handyman Tools - Plyers, Scissors, Hammer, Screwdriver. Just the basic things you need when working on hands on projects like these. 

4. Chalk - For marking where to cut on the fabric. It will make things much more simple, trust me.

# Cut out that Fabric!

I don't really like measuring things, I'm more of an "eyeballer," so I can't really help you on how to determine numeric measurements. However,
