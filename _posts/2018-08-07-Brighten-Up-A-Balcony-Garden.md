# Ideas hand picked from my garden garunteed to liven up any balcony or small porch.


I've been cleaning up my balcony this summer. It was what could be expected of a small back porch - cluttered, dusty, and not very hospitable. A year ago, I set up some Halloween decorations and never took them all down. Then, my neighbor spilled a whole drink off their balcony and it got all over my seat cushions and chairs. All past attempts at plants had died during a surprise winter snow. Dead plants, weird stains. My balcony was a mess.

I decided that enough was enough and from now on I would be one of those "cool neighbors" with a fancy, stylish balcony. Except, I don't wanna pay for anything if I can help it and the rest has to be DIY. And I'll need color - lots of it. And new plants. Now I've got a theme. Artsy Hippie Boho Chic.â„¢ 

Here's what I've come up with so far. A flurry of simple crafts and ideas that helped make my drab, dusty balcony into something more warm, inviting and vibrant. Perhaps they can help you transform your balcony or patio into something more fun, too.

#Hit up those curb alert specials

First things first, for a cool porch you need some places to sit and some stuff to put things on. Most of what is outside on my balcony has always been curb alert items that were found off the side of the road or especially near my neighborhood dumpster, where college kids often haul off most of their non essential furniture while moving out. In fact, neighborhoods with a high population of college students (near a school for example) tend to throw away really good stuff. 

I could go on and on about the best places to check for curb alert stuff, but that's a different article completely. For now I will say, keep your eyes peeled for the good stuff, don't be embarassed to rummage or pick, and start growing your collection of free stuff. Why does it matter if something on your porch is brand new or not, anyways? It's going to get rained on, stuff spilled on it, bugs crawling on it... that shiny new table or chair isn't going to stay shiny forever, so you might as well just lean in.  

##Refurbished Chairs Project
[INSERT IMAGE OF CHAIRS HERE]/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I have found so many cool things- my favorites are easily these fancy wooden chairs. They retail anywhere from $60 - $150 a chair in the store. I got them for free next to the dumpster, both in great shape, just missing the cushions. The cushions themselves can be $30 a piece, but I had some fabric and stuffing laying around so it cost me nothing to make new ones. 

I made mine fancy, but a simple square pillow shape would be an excellent first timer project. The trick is either using a "weatherproofed" fabric, or like in my case, jumping through a few hoops to prepare regular fabric for being outdoors. **I "treated" the fabric with a light layer of gesso on the back to prevent the fabric from soaking up as much moisture**. It works against rain showers, but I don't trust leaving my cushions out in heavy rain! If it's storming I will usually stack them against my door or somewhere they won't get waterlogged. But hey... it was all free, and they're comfortable chairs, so it's worth the small sacrifice. 

FYI: If this is a topic that interests you, I wrote a previous article where my friend and I reupholstered this old ottoman she found, and the results were shocking.
