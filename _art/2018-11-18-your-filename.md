Do you know the legend of The Bag of Holding? It is said to be a magical bag that is capable of containing objects much larger than its own size. Some say the items are simply transported to another dimension entirely. This is my interpretation of a real-life Bag of Holding.

These bags were made from second-hand T-shirts that have been given a brand new life. One benefit of using T-shirt textiles for the body of the bag is that the fabric has an incredible amount of stretch to it - enough to carry a substantial amount of items, much larger than the initial size of the bag itself.


**Some minor defects (stitching irregularities) should be expected. This bag is intentionally made in a "distressed" style.**
