![House Plants Sticker Pack Sample]({{site.baseurl}}/media/House Plants Stickers.png)

House plants bring a wonderful element of nature back into our busy lives. I wanted to create a series of stickers inspired by the plants floating around my own home. I also included some of my favorite vine border designs, which never fail to liven up a journal page with their fun foliage. If you're a lover of gardening or always aspired to have a green thumb, these cute little stickers are for you. Most stickers are half an inch, some are a little smaller than that. All of them are made from paper, so avoid contact with water.
