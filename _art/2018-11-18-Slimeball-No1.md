I've always been fond of the Ed "Big Daddy" Roth style of cartoons- highly detailed depictions of grotesque, slimy things with bugging eyes and snaggled teeth. This series of Slimeballs was a fun attempt at playing with this style. I also experimented with textures and patterns, adding a three dimensional black line partially around the creature and creating the background by using a reflective piece of sheer fabric.
