In my collage drawings, I like to address tough subjects in veiled, symbolic ways. I prefer these pieces to be up to the interpretation of the viewer. They are mostly done through stream of consciousness, each shape organically filling the space in order to illustrate the bigger picture. These works are often pictures within pictures in that way- two separate points of interest depicted in the same image. If you're having difficulty seeing the "bigger picture," try squinting your eyes while viewing the artwork.

Acrylic ink / Ready to Hang / Approx. 11" x 17"
