The funny joke about my Ghoulish Girls illustrative series is the nipples. I wanted to make a specific distinguishing detail between the Girls and the Ghouls- if the creature has nipples or not. This was a deliberate choice. I wanted to highlight the double standard in mainstream media that polices women's bodies but not men's. A vanilla image of a topless woman displaying her bare breasts would be quickly taken down from any modern social media, but post the same image with a couple of small details omitted and suddenly it's okay to share. Why are women's nipples so much more offensive than a man's? I can't answer that. But my reply can be malicious compliance, to the point of absurdity. That's why, in my illustrations, Bat Boys are allowed to have nipples and Bat Girls aren't.
