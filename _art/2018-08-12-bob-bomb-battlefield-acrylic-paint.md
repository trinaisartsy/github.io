I don't usually do fan art, but we're big Nintendo fans in this household, and I wanted to make a nice game themed painting for the living room. This is a recreation of the a "painting" featured in the game Mario 64. I liked this particular painting in the game because it's such an iconic image in pop culture, without being too "on the nose" about its reference material.
