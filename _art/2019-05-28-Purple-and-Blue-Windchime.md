This series of beautiful sea shell windchimes was locally sourced from Charleston's own Sullivan's Island. Thanks to Mother Nature, I didn't have to drill holes in the shells, because moon snails had already taken care of it for me. Moon snails live off the coast of Charleston and feast on mollusks and clams, leaving a neat, tiny holes in the discarded shells of their prey. The snails and clams may be forever embroiled in conflict, but ironically, hearing the clinking and clanking of their shells strung up together could even be considered peaceful. The Yin and Yang balance of nature, in a way. Feature this cosmic struggle in your own garden today!

These windchimes may be displayed indoors or outdoors.
