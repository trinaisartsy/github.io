I became intrigued with Blue Footed Boobies after reading the book "Galapagos" by Kurt Vonnegut. This was a companion painting to a long term project I was working on that involved an appliqued scene with a pair of Blue Footed Boobies. 


_"The courtship dance of the blue-footed boobies, which Mrs. Onassis suddenly wanted to see so much in person, has not changed one iota in a million years. Neither have these birds learned to be afraid of anything. Neither have they shown the slightest inclination to give up on aviation and become submarines._

_As for the meaning of the courtship dance of the blue-footed boobies: The birds are huge molecules with bright blue feet and have no choice in the matter. By their very nature, they have to dance exactly like that."_
