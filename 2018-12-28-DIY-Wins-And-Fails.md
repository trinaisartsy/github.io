## The Best and Worst Projects I DIY'd This Year

Styrofoam Tech Couch - Win

One of the weirdest projects I came up with this year was the idea to wrap some batted fabric around a piece of recycled styrofoam to make this silly little "electronics couch." Even weirder was that it actually came in handy this year as a cute way to organize our game controllers and remotes. It still reminds me of those weird little cellphone chairs you could buy at Claire's Club in the mid 2000's, though. 

DIY Z Pallete - Wash

This has been a year in which I explored personal beauty. And boy, did I explore "beauty" when I made this stupid thing. The idea was that you could make your own custom eyeshadow pallete if you bust all your eyeshadow rounds out of the packages and stick them all on a magnetic Z Pallete. The problem was, my current collection of makeup was so cheap it wasn't magnetic, so when I went to make my Z pallete I ended up just gluing these guys in. The finished product didn't really serve useful to me and I don't think it really saved much time either. Plus, it was a huge mess, trying to dig all my eyeshadows out of their plastic encasings. I gouged like, all of them. I wouldn't want to try this again with my nicer shadows I upgraded to later in the year. This would only be useful if you had just a TON of mini crappy eyeshadows that you used all the time but constantly had to dig around to find the perfect color. And even then, maybe I'd suggest just upgrading to better eyeshadows, or buying an awesome custom Z pallete off of Etsy instead. The idea behind this thing intriuges me, I was just never able to pull it off.

Candy Boquets - Win

Okay, I know it's no mystery candy boquets are cool as heck. But how cheap and easy they were to make was news to me. I made so many of these things this year for birthdays and holidays. There are tons of great tutorials on youtube about how to make these, so I won't go into deep detail, but in short all it takes is a low temp hot glue gun, a floral block (or recycled styrofoam), and a ton of dollar store candy or something equally as rad. Trust me on this one, these things are great fun to gift and even better to recieve. 


Patch Board - win

I've been ordering patches and pins like crazy this year. I like having them around- they're handy for projects and crafts every now and then. It seemed like a shame to keep them stored hidden in a drawer somewhere. I came across these cheap cork boards at an outlet store and knew what I had to do. Since the creation of this project, my collection has actually grown quite a bit, and I had to get another board to accomodate them all! Still, it turned out to be a very cool wall hanging in my studio, and a lot more inspiring than hiding the designs away in storage.

Basket Weaving

Sprucing up dollar baskets - Win *

I'm calling this little project a win because we still use these baskets for storage, and I still think some of them are quite cute. However, there would definitely be a few things I would do differently if I wanted to make these baskets more "home decor friendly." I'd probably try to be more thoughtful about coordinating the fabric colors
