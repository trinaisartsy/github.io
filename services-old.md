Why Pick Trina as Your Artist?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a learner at heart, and I enjoy sharing my discoveries and knowledge with the world. I have studied under local working artists including [Phillip Hyman](https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/prolific-artist-phillip-hyman-spreads-the-love-underground/Content?oid=2410259), [Tate Nation](https://www.tatenation.com/) and [Peggie Hartwell](http://www.peggiehartwell.com/). In school, I participated in every extracurricular art class available to me and made strong marks on my 2010 Advance Placement Art Portfolio (3*). I've taught art in a variety of settings including summer camps, drink and paint studios, and one on one tutoring. For more information on my experience, visit my Linkedin.  
  
 I am available for one on one instruction or small classes in a variety of artistic principals and I have flexible hours to fit your busy schedule. Available on weekends or after school. Contact me to discuss specifics such as class location and booking times.  
  
Skype Session Available - Too far away to make it to class? Book a class via Skype. Contact me for more details.  
  
\* I could've done better on my AP art score, but I missed a lot of important things about the portfolio that in hindsight I would've fixed. If only I had someone to give me that advice!  I wrote about the experience on my blog - I highly recommend the read to any stressed out teen who is struggling with their portfolio.

Testimonials and Praise

Here's what others are saying about my work!

  <br>

_"Trina helped guide me when I first started working at Wine and Design and I was impressed with her teaching and customer service skills. She is very creative and a gifted artist. I was also very impressed with my experience in working with Trina on a Fundraiser for The Flowertown Players Theater. Trina curated a pop up art show beautifully and completed set up, exhibition and take down in under 12 hours!"_ \- Heather J.

   <br>

"_I got to know Trina under very unusual circumstances, but it’s through those circumstances that I got to know what a special person she truly is.  For years, I have wanted to buy myself a painting of a lion that “spoke to me.”  I had seen some of Trina's artwork, so one day I asked her to paint me a lion because I have never been able to find one I liked enough to buy. And believe me, I’ve looked. I explained to her what I wanted, and when I saw the finished product, I couldn’t have been happier. He’s perfect. He’s beautiful. I told Trina how grateful I was and how he was exactly what I wanted. It’s one of those situations where it turned out better than I could have ever imagined. She told me she painted it with love and I believe her. I know she did. I can tell she did. That’s just the type of person she is. She puts her heart, and more importantly her soul, into everything she does._"** - **Donna G.
